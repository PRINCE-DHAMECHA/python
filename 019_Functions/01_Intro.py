# * Functions in Python provide organized, reusable and modular code to perform a set of specific actions. Functions simplify the coding process, prevent redundant logic, and make the code easier to follow. This topic describes the declaration and utilization of functions in Python.

# * Python has many built-in functions like print(), input(), len(). Besides built-ins you can also create your own functions to do more specific jobsâ€”these are called user-defined functions
