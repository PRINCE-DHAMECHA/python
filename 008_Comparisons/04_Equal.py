x = 2
y = 1
print(x != y)
print('12' != '12')
# * This returns True if x and y are not equal and otherwise returns False

print(x == y)
# * This expression evaluates if x and y are the same value and returns the result as a boolean value. Generally both type and value need to match, so the int 12 is not the same as the string '12'.

print('12' == 12)
# False
# Hey there Javascript developer :)
# It's false :)
# '12' != 12 :)
# Sorry :)
