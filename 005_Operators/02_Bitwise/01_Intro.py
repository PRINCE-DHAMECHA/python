# ~ Bitwise operations alter binary strings at the bit level. These operations are incredibly basic and are directly supported by the processor. These few operations are necessary in working with device drivers, low-level graphics, cryptography, and network communications. This section provides useful knowledge and examples of Python's bitwise operators.

# ~ What is 2s complement?

# To represent let's say -5

# 0 0101(+5 in 2s comp represent) ->  1 1010(1s comp) -> 1 1011(add 1)

# 1 1011 is -5 in binary

# * In conclusion we write positive number as it is and for representing negative number we'll take 1s complement of corresponding positive number and then add 1 which will be 2s complement
