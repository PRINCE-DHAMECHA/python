# ~ The << operator will perform a bitwise "left shift," where the left operand's value is moved left by the number of bits given by the right operand

# 2 = 0b10
print(2 << 2)
# Out: 8
# 8 = 0b1000

# * Performing a left bit shift of 1 is equivalent to multiplication by 2:


# ~ The >> operator will perform a bitwise "right shift," where the left operand's value is moved right by the number of bits given by the right operand.

# 8 = 0b1000
print(8 >> 2)
# Out: 2
# 2 = 0b10

# *Performing a right bit shift of 1 is equivalent to integer division by 2.
