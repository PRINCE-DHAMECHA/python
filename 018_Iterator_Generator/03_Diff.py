# ~ Iterator

# * Class is used to implement an iterator

# * Local Variables aren't used here.

# * Iterators are used mostly to iterate or convert other objects to an iterator using iter() function.

# * Iterator uses iter() and next() functions

# * Every iterator is not a generator

# ~ Generator

# * Function is used to implement a generator.

# * All the local variables before the yield function are stored.

# * Generators are mostly used in loops to generate an iterator by returning all the values in the loop without affecting the iteration of the loop

# * Generator uses yield keyword

# * Every generator is an iterator
